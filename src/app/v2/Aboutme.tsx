          Iâ€™m enthusiastic about building software that helps people, eager to
          learn how to develop more robust systems, and excited to own and drive
          impactful projects. I care deeply about my work and building products
          while working directly with end users has taught me the importance of
          paying attention to the needs of the client. I focus on the details to
          help ensure we're solving the right problems in the right ways
